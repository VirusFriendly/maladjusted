to make...
gcc -o elfedit *.c

once a program is stipped of it's elf headers, it can still run although debugging programs such as gdb objdump and various traces wont work.

to aid in obfuscation, statically link the program, and then strip it using strip, then strip using elfedit.

for options type elfedit -?
